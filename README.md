Spark 360
=========

Spark 360 was a gaming client for Android. It was available on Google Play between 2010 and 2014, during which time it supported Xbox Live and the PlayStation Network.

As of August 29, 2014, the vast majority of the application ceased to function due to changes in the Xbox Live portal. As a result, **Spark 360 is no longer maintained**, and is provided here in the hope that it (or parts of it) may be useful.

Spark 360 was also available on iOS for a time - source code for the iOS version [is also available](https://github.com/pokebyte/Spark360-iOS).
